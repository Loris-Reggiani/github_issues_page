See #21233 for additional context.\r\n\r\nI added a dev-only internal warning that fires whenever this is the case. That's the first commit, which causes a handful of test failures. I opted to go this route instead of writing dedicated tests because the exact codepath that triggers this scenario isn't that interesting and likely wouldn't survive a refactor. The warning is like an internal property invariant that ensures the model is consistent even if implementation details around it change. It also covers future features or codepaths that might affect `finishedLanes`.\r\n\r\nThe second commit fixes all these warnings by refactoring `performSyncWorkOnRoot` and `performConcurrentWorkOnRoot`.

Go to https://jeffreyatw.com/static/voiceover-react using iOS, enable VoiceOver\r\n2. Swipe to first \"Not clicked\" h2, observe VoiceOver reads content correctly\r\n3. Click the first \"click me\" button\r\n4. Move VoiceOver's focus back to first h2, which is now \"Clicked\"\r\n5. VoiceOver **incorrectly** reads it as \"Not clicked, heading level 2\"\r\n6. Swipe to the second \"Not clicked\" h2, observe VoiceOver reads content correctly\r\n7. Click the second \"click me\" button\r\n8. Move VoiceOver's focus back to second h2, which is now \"Clicked\"\r\n9. VoiceOver correctly reads it as \"Clicked, heading level 2\"\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React.

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\nAs discussed in #21057, passing a class to `useState` and `setState` functions can be problematic because of the internal structure of those functions to check whether the user passed the state directly or using a function. As suggested in the mentioned issue, checking the name of the function (if the user passed a function to `useState` and `setState`) whether its first letter is capitalized or not and warning the user if it starts with a capital letter could be a helpful hint.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I added a small if block which will work in the development build to check the first letter of the function name. To get the name of the function, I used the `displayName` and `name` properties. Even though these two aren't supported in all browsers, it still covers a big percentage. I searched the codebase for alternative approaches but this was the most common way. If there are alternative and better approaches to get the name of the function, we can update that logic for sure.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (__DEV__) {\r\n  const name = initialState.displayName || initialState.name || '';\r\n  if (name.charAt(0) !== name.charAt(0).toLowerCase()) {\r\n    console.warn(...);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI made the same changes to both `ReactFiberHooks.old.js` and `ReactFiberHooks.new.js` although I observed that `*.old.js` were the one used in my local environment. I searched for the differences between these two files but couldn't find anything. If the change is not needed in the `*.new.js` file, we can remove that part as well.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots/videos if the pull request changes the user interface. -->\r\nFor the test strategy, I added two basic tests to `ReactHooks-test.internal.js`, for both `useState` and `setState` functions. In the tests, a function whose name starts with a capital letter is passed and the console warning is expected as a result of those function calls.\r\n\r\nIf needed, test cases for success scenarios can be added. However, as far as I observed, most of the other test cases are failing if a warning is fired in a success scenario.\r\n",

I probably won't do this now but I want to write it down for future reference.\r\n\r\nCurrently, after we gather a list of types that need to be updated in the tree, we scan the tree and tag Fibers to be updated. This happens [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0853aab74dc8285401e62d1e490551ba3c96fd64/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHotReloading.new.js#L267-L339). But like https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20417 shows, this doesn't work if the type is not in the tree. E.g. if the function we changed is only being called directly, and its \"type\" is not the actual wrapper that exists in the tree.\r\n\r\nAn alternative implementation could instead inject a special Hook call into each registered component. For example by generating a wrapper. That Hook would return the latest actual implementation, _and_ schedule updates on itself when it changes. Which means there would be no need to scan the tree at all. Instead, each component would register itself for updates. For false positives outside of React rendering, the Hook would just be callthrough so it wouldn't break anything.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a pretty significant change to the implementation so I'm probably not going to work on this now. Maybe we could consider it next time we need to change the implementation details. Or maybe somebody sufficiently motivated wants to hack on this. I can provide some code pointers but it’s not a beginner-friendly issue.",
